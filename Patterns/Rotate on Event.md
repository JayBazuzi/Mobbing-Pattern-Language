# Also Known As

# Context

You already have reliably bite-sized events.

Requires [Musical Chairs].

# Purpose

You want to create a feeling of individual accomplishment for each mob, instead of the sense of shared accomplishment for the mob.

# How To

Instead of rotating on a timer, the Navigator does a complete thought, and then the group rotates.

One example is ping-pong: Write a test. Rotate. Make it pass. Repeat.

Another is koans: Complete a koan. Rotate.

# Consequences

Can detract from shared mindset, because you never get one Navigator having to complete another Navigator's thought.

# Collaborators
