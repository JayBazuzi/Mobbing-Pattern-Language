# Name

Quickest Rotation

# Intent

- Keep group energy level high
- Keep mobbers engaged
- Prevent driver and navigator from becoming overwhelmed
- Prevent driver and navigator from becoming frustrated

# Context

Any mob can apply this, but it's especially good for new mobs and when people are frustrated, overwhelmed, or disengaged.

# Purpose

Novice mobs often choose overly long rotation times. This leads to frustration, overwhelm, and disengement in a way that is difficult to trace back to the rotation time.

Make it possible to work with a 1-minute rotation timer, and get everyone used to how that feels. While you don't necessarily need to maintain a 1-minute rotation time for normal work, you should bias towards shorter rather than longer rotations.

# How To

Run Musical Chairs to people warmed up and in the flow.

Set a 5 minute mob timer. Run 1 iteration, either in a kata or in real work. 

Have a micro-retro on friction you bumped into that makes this rotation time difficult. Some areas to consider:

- build and test time
- slow driver swap

Reduce the timer to 4 minutes and run 1 or 2 more iterations. Repeat the micro-retro.

Continue shrinking the iteration time until you bump into barrier. Retro to address that barrier, and shrink again.

You should be able to get to smooth development with a 1 minute timer when working on a kata or similar quick build-and-test project.
