# Context

Some members of the mob are not in the same room. Maybe you're all in different countries; maybe you just want to skip the commute on Wednesdays.

You already have a history of working together in person. We are social primates and we need those memories.

# Purpose

Keep the mob cohesive and balanced even when you're not all together.

# How To

- If two people are in the same room, have them move apart so they can't see and hear each other. This creates a level playing field.
- Everyone has a webcam.
- Everyone has two displays. (Could be laptop + external monitor).
- Put everyone else's video next to your webcam. 

Now, when you want to talk to them, you'll naturally turn to face them, which means facing the camera, which they will see and naturally recognize.
