# Also Known As

# Context

An experienced mob that is self-aware enough to notice when devices are becoming a distraction.

# Purpose

Feed the mob with useful details without occupying the whole mob in a bit of research on a problem that is not core to the mob's work.

# How To

Everyone in the mob has a laptop / tablet / phone on hand. They can research small ideas on the internet, and feed their findings back in to the mob.

For example:

- How to use the IDE
- Some detail about the API/library/framework in use

# Consequences

- May keep the mob focused on the problem at hand.
- May distract mobbers with email/twitter/reddit.

# Collaborators

[Take a Break] when distractions become too overwhelming to continue mobbing.
