# Also Known As

- The Meadow

# Context

Someone doesn't want to be in the mob but doesn't want to leave completely either. Maybe a newbie, or a neuroatypical person, or a product owner.

# Purpose

Give the person a place to stay connected to the mob without needing to be fully engaged.

# How To

Create a comfortable place on the edge of the mob. A sofa or recliner is good. 

Invite the person to hang out in the space with a laptop. They can email or whatever while the mob works. 

# Consequences

- The mob might have a question this person can answer. They ask the question right away, instead of waiting to get an answer.

- The person might hear something they need to be involved with. They speak up right away instead of finding out later.
