# Also Known As

"The Meadow"

# Context

Someone connected to the work of the mob who doesn't want to / need to be in the mob, like a product owner or domain expert or a shy newbie.

# Purpose

- Make that person's insights available to the mob.

- Help them get comfortable with the idea of mobbing.

# How To

Make a comfortable space for someone to sit near the mob, close enough that they can hear the mob conversations and see the mob's screen. It's OK for them to use a laptop to do other work if that's what they need. 

They can answer the mob's questions, insert their insights, or sit quietly.

If someone in the mob needs a break, they can sit on the sofa, too. But maybe the whole mob needs a break.
