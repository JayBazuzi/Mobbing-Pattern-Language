# Also Known As

# Context

The mob is uncertain about how to move forward on a problem, or they don't understand the problem they are trying to solve. The next move is fuzzy and the goal is unclear.

# Purpose

Focus the team on the problem to solve, and remove the distraction of code, and hands on keyboard.

# How To

Stop coding. This must be done away from the computer.

Set up a whiteboard, or (preferably) large moveable paper backing like butcher paper, or large sticky sheet for data collection. Use sticky notes to capture information about problem context. Organize the context into digestible pieces.

Techniques which can help organize thought:

- Event Storming
- Domain Mapping
- ECO Mapping

# Consequences

- The whole mob will better understand the problem, and solution space
- Context for a problem can move out of people's heads and into a physical space where collaboration on ideas is easier to manage
- Richer understanding of the problem can be gained, giving insight into domain language, and bounded context
