# Also Known As

Use Two Timers

# Context

Rotating the driver is possible but painful, it takes too long, hindering flow.

# Purpose

Navigators rotate smoothly. Better flow.

# How To

Set up two separate timers - one for drivers and the other for navigators.

The driver timer is slower (e.g. 15 min) than the navigator timer (e.g. 3 min).

Avoid the same person being both driver and navigator by skipping them on the shorter timer when that happens.

# Consequences

-   Some people might not drive at all.
-   We avoid having to smooth out the driver rotation.

# Collaborators
