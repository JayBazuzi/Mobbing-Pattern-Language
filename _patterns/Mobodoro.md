# Context

Intermediate mob that is ready to tune their process.

# Purpose

Improve quickly, in tiny increments, all day long.

# How To

Work in 25-minute intervals, starting with a couple minutes of planning, followed by a standard mob rotation, and ending with a micro-retrospective. 

Between intervals take a break 5-minute break. Everyone *must* leave the mobbing area.

After a few iterations, take a 1/2-hour break.

This practice does not place daily/weekly/sprintly retrospectives. You still need an opportunity to dig more deeply into underlying causes.

# Consequences

Narrows focus during the mobodoro. This can lead to increased productivity, but also makes people tired faster.

The narrow focus could cause tunnel vision, which is why the planning is important.
