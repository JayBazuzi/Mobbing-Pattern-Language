# Story 

Story #1: The mob wants to invite an expert to join them.
The expert resists because they think it will be slow or they think that exploring the unknown requires banging their head against the problem until they discover something worth sharing.

Story #2: A group needs to brainstorm and discover product/feature opportunities, looking for a thin-sliced MVP that is a bargain both regarding functionality and technology.
This requires input from multiple disciplines, and some do not normally mob (e.g., skeptical, inexperienced, etc.).
It has lots of unknowns. Many in the team are not skilled in a whiteboarding tool to facilitate and quickly capture the discussion.

# Also Known As

Wheelman

# Context

Skilled Driver(s) / Unskilled Mob + exploring ambiguity / unknowns + high stakes (time, skepticism, precarious engagement)

- Skilled Driver(s): One or more drivers who are skilled in the tools, good at listening, can interpret domain expert ideas with high level or low level of details.
- Unskilled mob: Intelligent team members but lack skill in specific tool and/or domain.
- Exploring ambiguity / unknowns = ... 
- High Stakes (time, skepticism, precarious engagement) = Either time is short, some are skeptical of use of mobbing in this context, or potential difficulty sustaining engagement

# Purpose

Maintain the engagement and winsomely persuade skeptics, while achieving a common goal (e.g., shared understanding, problem solving, knowledge sharing, etc.).

# How To

We narrow the pool of drivers to only the very best drivers who can quickly and accurately wield the tools and facilitate.
This driver should take the "raw materials" from the group, turn them into a result, and give credit to the mob.

# Consequences

This avoids losing the attention of the group and keep the learning in the domain instead of in the tools. For those skeptical of mobbing, they see a steady flow of productivity and can see an "unnecessary" person provide a valuable insight that otherwise would have been missed.
