# Also Known As

# Context
This is good for any mob, that wants to build a bond and develop respect for eachother's ideas.

# Purpose
To build collaboration and bonding in the mob and reinforce psychological safety and trust. This also increases empathy and understanding of others' points of view.

# How To
Each talker starts their turn by building on the last Talker's ideas, with the phrase "Yes, and...". They avoid words like "But", "No" or "However", as those implicitly criticize the previous talker's ideas and usually signal a deviation from their intent. We always assume the previous navigator has done the best job they could given the information they had.

Whenever the previous talker feels criticized, it can cause defensiveness, and prevent the previous talkers from contributing more to the conversation.

# Consequences
Using Yes, and builds trust and respect with the previous navigator
