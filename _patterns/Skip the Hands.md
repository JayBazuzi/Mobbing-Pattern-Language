# Context

Remote mob working with AI agents. The talker dictates exact words for the typist to type into AI prompts. This is slow and wastes human effort on transcription.

# Purpose

Remove the typist as human transcriber. Let the talker speak directly to the AI at natural speed.

# How To

1. Typist sets up voice transcription tool (Wispr Flow, etc.) and uses speakers so the tool can pick up remote voices
2. Talker speaks their prompt naturally (Talker -> mic -> video conf -> speakers -> mic -> transcribe)
3. Typist clicks to capture and insert transcription into AI prompt
4. Mob reviews before sending (good practice)

# Consequences

Much faster prompting. Talker can speak at natural pace instead of dictating slowly. Typist freed from transcription duty but still controls when to capture.

Preserves "everybody hears the intention, everybody in the know."

Can extend to capture multi-person discussion and feed to AI.

Requires audio setup where transcription picks up remote voices from speakers.
