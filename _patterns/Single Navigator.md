# Context

New mobs.

New Drivers, especially drivers who are not comfortable programming.

Mobs where many people have an idea and can't agree on how to proceed.

# Purpose

Ease the job of the Driver in understanding how to proceed.

Help a mob deal with difficult in selecting a path forward.

# How To

Select a single person as Navigator. Everyone who is not a Driver or Navigator is a Mobber. 

The Driver only accepts instructions from the Navigator. 

The Mobbers are responsible ensuring the Navigator is never starved for possible next steps.

The Navigator is responsible for selecting one and feeding it to the Driver.

If the Navigator knows how they want to proceed, that is fine. If unsure how to proceed, they should ask the mob for ideas.
