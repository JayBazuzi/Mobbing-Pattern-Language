# Also Known As

# Context

Brand new mobbers.

# Purpose

Get used to what it feels like to rotate. 

Remove the biggest impediments to smooth rotation.

Relieve the stress of the first Driver and first Navigator who were afraid they're about to be in a hot seat.

# How To

After explaining to the mob that they will rotate when the timer rings, ring the timer immediately. Tell them to get up and rotate.

Congratulate them, then explain that we need this to go smoothly. Have the group look for impediments. Did they move serially, requiring _n_ actions for _n_ people? Did furniture get in the way? Did they trip over cables?

Repeat several times. Try to make it light-hearted.
